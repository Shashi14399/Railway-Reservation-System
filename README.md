# Railway-Reservation-System
A website for railway ticket booking and reservation.
This is my Database Management System project. 
This basicaly a website for reserving railway tickets, general or AC from a particular source to a particular destination. 
There are various trains to choose from. Each train has a source, destination and intermediate stations.
There are special reservations (lesser ticket price) for people of some professions and disabled. Tickets are also limited per train.
Frontend done using HTML and CSS. Database implemented and built using SQL and PHP used for backend.
